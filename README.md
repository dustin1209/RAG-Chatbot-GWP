# RAG Chatbot for Environmental Impact of Ceiling Systems

## Overview
This RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot is designed to support early-stage planning by providing insights into the environmental impact of ceiling systems. Built with a React-based agent, it leverages vector search to retrieve relevant information from a curated literature database.  

The chatbot also integrates with a specialized tool called **Compare Ceiling Systems**, which combines literature data with proprietary generated data. This tool can calculate the **Global Warming Potential (GWP)** of different ceiling systems based on span length and load capacity, allowing for precise comparisons during conceptual design.

## Features
- **Literature-based RAG chatbot:** Answers questions and provides insights on ceiling systems' environmental impact.  
- **Vector search:** Quickly retrieves relevant information from a curated literature database.  
- **Compare Ceiling Systems tool:**  
  - Uses literature and proprietary generated data.  
  - Calculates GWP based on span length and load capacity.  
  - Supports data-driven comparisons for early planning stages.  

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React  
- **Backend / Agent:** RAG-based AI agent  
- **Search:** Vector search for literature retrieval  
- **Tool integration:** GWP calculator for ceiling systems  

## Usage
1. Ask the chatbot questions about ceiling systems and their environmental impact.  
2. Use the **Compare Ceiling Systems** tool to calculate GWP for specific configurations.
